        <h3> So let's get a plan in place...</h3>
        
  
        <p> <u>What is my long term goal and/or Career Pathway?</u> </p>
           <p> I have decided to undertake this huge life change in order to get myself into a better position with more opportunities. I am investing in myself so that I can get a highly skilled  profession, one which enables me to have a better work life balance, and provide a more sustainable salary. 
            
            I am not sure which specific area of software development I am interested in just yet - that will come once I have had more experience with coding. Eventually I would like my skills to be good enough for me to develop my own company - whether that is tech, or something on the more creative side, possibly even creating my own side scrolling adventure game?. Right now I am still soaking in the possibilities. My main goal right now, is absorb as much information as possible, and get a good sense of all options. 
            
            I quit my stable job to tackle this, and it is literally a start to a whole new life. I am at the start of a long journey, but one of the best things I have ever done for myself.
            </p>
            
            
         <p>  <u>A description of my own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</u> </p>
            
           <p> I am a self motivator. I think this can be both a positive and a negative. It means that I don’t need anyone to ‘push’ me to study or do the things I need to do, but it also means that when I am not feeling in the zone, it can be hard for anyone else to help me get back to the right mindset. 
            
           I have had a lot of different jobs, which has forced me to learn a lot of different skills. In one job I had to interperate legislation, another policy wordings, in another I had to navigate complicated financial spreadsheets, and another how to manage a small hotel. Many of these things I thought my brain would never get the hang of. I know my brain has the capability to learn, which is a great strength when it comes to learning new things. 
            
            A learning limitation I will have to overcome is my memory! The ‘cramming for a test’ scenario which has been brought up a number of times in this course already, is kind of how my memory seems to function. I can gather up information, understand it fully and completely (even over a long period)… but if I do not need to tap into that for a few weeks or months, I find out my brain has completely removed any memory of this knowledge. So for me, this is going to be an area I need to focus on to be successful. I will need to dedicate some time at the end of the week to reflecting on all past things learnt.
            </p>
            

        <p>    <u> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</u> </p>
            
           <p> I would like to be able to think outside of the box more. While on some level I consider myself creative, there seems to be a creative wall which I can’t seem to jump out of. 
            </p>

            
            
            <p> <u>So, how is this all going to work? </u> </p>
            
            <p>All is chugging along quite nicely now, these first two weeks have gone at a nice easy pace, but how will I handle things in bootcamp? First and foremost before everything else… I will need to ensure my sleep schedule is on track. I can’t focus, and lose my desire to meaningfully engage without enough sleep. So this will be top of the priority list, followed by family time. With the strength of sleep and family I can be on top of my mental game. 
            
            I am one of those people who enjoys having a schedule. I like to know when I am working, when I am relaxing etc. So, creating and sticking to a schedule is very important to my success. I have made a schedule already, but I know this may need to be adjusted depending on how the actual experience goes. 
            
            Seeking help will be important. I am lucky as I have a supportive partner at home who is already a software engineer who is willing to help me whenever I get stuck, as well as the support from Dev Academy. I also don’t like to ask for help too early, so I will have to learn the right balance of asking for help at the right time as to not impede my own ability to work things out for myself, but also not get behind because I couldn’t work something out.
            
            From the facilitators, I think my main expectations of them, is to provide the reassurance that I am on the right track. I would expect them to let me know if I am falling behind, or if my quality of work is not meeting expectations. (While I am sure I would be able to tell these things myself, I am still new to this world, so might not realise). I have found it really helpful to be able to ask Jospeh things via slack, even if he does not respond straight away, just the process of asking someone questions has sometimes given me the jolt my brain needed and I have been able to work things out myself. As I typed this I realised I need to implement the rubber ducky method… note to self… buy a duck.
            
            My family is very important to me. My immediate household is my partner and my two cats who I love so much. I need to make sure that I am connected to them through this process, for my own mental health. So scheduling in time for them is a huge priority. Luckily, they don’t have bedtimes so making time for them all is not going to be too difficult. I will also have to schedule in a few dinners for my wider family, as this is also important to me to stay connected, even if it is in a smaller capacity. </p>

            <h3> Bootcamp Learning Plan </h3>
<p><u>What is your long term goals and/or career pathway?</u></p>

<p>
My previous jobs have been very mundane. The kind of jobs where everyday is the same, and I am completing the same tasks, in the same order, for the same goal. I am working towards a different career now. I can’t wait to get a position where every day I am working towards the completion of a project, problem solving different problems than the day before. I am looking to get a position which gives me the opportunity to work on lots of different things. Also still thinking about how I can use my skills to make my own business.
</p>



<p><u>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in bootcamp? </u></p>

<p>
As per my earlier self evaluation of my weaknesses, I still think that my memory will be a big limitation in bootcamp. I am mostly concerned that during peer programming I might hold someone else up while I go back to check on code syntax, etc that my brain has totally forgotten about. I still think my strengths lie in self motivation. This is going to be crucial for the time ahead.
</p>


<p><u> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </u></p>

<p>
I need to become more confident asking my peers for help. Normally this is not much of a problem for me, however this has been something I have found difficult through foundations, and I would like to get better at this aspect.
</p>

<p><u>What are my expectations from the Bootcamp Team </u></p>
<p>
I am not too sure what I expect just yet, but I am expecting the team to be kind, informative, patient and I hope they can communicate the ideas clearly. I think the 1-1 check ins and tech ins will be extremely important for me during bootcamp. With all the information which will be thrown at me, I personally feel like I will need those one on one times to confirm that I am on the right track. Always good to get that external validation, or further assistance to get back on track.
</p>


<p><u> What are my expectations of myself during Bootcamp? </u></p>
<p>
I am expecting a lot of myself. I expect myself to wake up each morning determined to learn as much as I can. I expect myself to force myself to be in a good mood, even when I am not feeling it. I also want to push myself to interact with the cohort as much as possible. I am also going to expect myself to spend some time to look after my wellbeing while going through bootcamp.
