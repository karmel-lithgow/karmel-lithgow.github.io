        <p>Here we go, time to spill some personal details...</p>
  
        <p> Hi, I am Karmel. I was born and raised in Auckland, and am in my thirties and looking forward to my new start with Dev Academy. </p>
            
            <p> <u>Personal Achievements I am proud of:</u> </p>
<ul>
            <li>Living overseas for two years: something I never imagined I would do. </li>
            <li>My family. I have a lovely partner and my two kittys who I love with all my heart. One of the reasons I am studying this year is to make a better life for them, more money brings more opportunities, more flexibility and working from home also brings more opportunities. </li>
            <li>Making cakes. Something I have wanted to do my whole life, and I finally decided to give it a go, and now I am making birthday cakes for my friends and family. I feel really good knowing I am able to do that for them. </li>
            <li>Buying a home. Having a place that I can call my own, keep my family safe and happy in.</li>
</ul> 
    </p> 
            
            <p><u>Work achievements I am proud of:</u>
            
<ul>        
    <li>When I worked in border security I created a large reference document. It took months to collate and put together. </li>
   <li> Creating a new form used throughout the business for international transfers </li>
       
        <li> Starting this course with Dev Academy. This is a huge step for me. Taking a Giant risk like this </li>
</ul>
        </p>
            
            
            <p>
                <u>What do my friends and family think of me?</u> 
            </p>    
                
            <p>Well I asked them for stories they wanted to share which would show the type of person I am... Which is never a weird or awkward thing to ask people to do... But here is what they said...</p>

   
<ul>
        <p>
            <li> 
                <u>Laurie</u>
            “When we were living in London, and had plans to go back to New Zealand and buy a house, I was offered my dream job. You stayed longer so that I wouldn’t miss my opportunity”.
            </li>
        </p>

            <p>
                <li> <u>Jemma</u>
            “How about when you slept on the couch with Timmy when she had her operation so that she wouldn’t be alone? Shows your wonderful heart and how caring you are”.  </li> </p>

            <p>
                <li> <u>My Dad</u>
            “Or the time that you picked up a broken toy at the shop and wouldn’t choose a new one as you felt its feelings would get hurt”. </li> </p>
            
            <p> 
                <li> <u>Little Sister</u>
            “Ooooh loving because you always had that bear and looked after it with all its clothes”. </li> </p>
            
            <p>
                <li> <u>My Mum</u>
            “You have a strong moral compass about right and wrong” </li> </p>
          
            <p>
                <li> <u>Hayden</u>
            “You are the cake master for all your friends and family, and you are creative with your drawings etc. Also how imaginative you are”. 

            <p> 
                <li> <u>Timmy the Cat</u>
            “Murrr” </li> </p>
            
            
        </li>
        </p>
            
        </ul>

</p>

<p>
            Haha, so seeing the things my friends and family think of me, really emphasises that I care about people and things. Which is true. My family is super important to me, and really I don’t care that much about other things. I have never really chased any sporting goals, or job goals… But I always wanted to have a happy life with the right people around me. I am proud of where I am in my life, and think I have achieved that. </p>
            
           <p> <u>My Myers Briggs Personality type is: Advocate: INFJ-A / INJF-T</u>  </p>
            
            
            <p>I don’t know how accurate this really is, as it claims that we make concrete steps towards things, and I can’t say that is something I have actively done perhaps up until this point.
            
            
           <p> <u> Describe your core personal values: </u> </p>
            <p>My personal values are family, loyalty, caring, dependability and reliability.
            
            I love my family and friends, and feel happy when I have done something to brighten their day. I try to do the right thing and put other people first. And honestly, I don’t always succeed. I tend to burn myself out and despite my best intentions things don’t always go the way I intend. It is nice to know that despite that, my friends and family see my good intentions. Yay. </p>
            
            <p> <u>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </u> </p>
           <p>I really can’t think of any ethical decisions I have had to make. The closest thing I can think of is really lame, however I thought of it being a problem at the time. I had just started my first ‘real’ job, one which it was not ok to partake in any kinds of recreational drugs, or even associate with anyone who did. I was at a party, and some people were smoking weed. I had been advised in this situation I would have to leave. So I had a decision, do I a) comply with my work views and be rude to my friends by leaving… or do I b) stay away from the person smoking and continue enjoying my time with my friends. I decided to stay, and just remove myself from the presence of that person. This came down to my own personal views of what is right and wrong. While I understood my works position on this (due to my role at the time), however, I evaluated the situation and decided that I was far removed from the situation enough for it to not cause any issues in my work or personal life. </p>
        </p>
            
            <p><u>Describe how culture has influenced your values and identity</u>
            I grew up thinking we had rather a lack of culture. White New Zealanders do seem to have a lack of anything really distinctive, no special clothing, unique food, or exciting holidays that make us distinct from anyone else. My family culture however I think has contributed a lot to the way that I deal with people. Growing up my family avoided talking about things that made people uncomfortable, and as a consequence of that I felt I was unable to express a lot of the difficulties I was experiencing. I think this has made me more empathetic, and able to read the unspoken in others a lot more. It has taught me that people are deeper than just what is said. </p>
            
            <p><u>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</u>
            It must be noted, my friends and family are not the type of people who will focus on my weak points, and accordingly have only provided good feedback. Therefore the limitations will need to be from my perspective only. I think my limitations revolve around when I talk myself down, or believe that I can’t do something. I have done a lot of reflection on this already, and believe that I can do this, even though it might be difficult.
            </p>

            
            <p><u>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your leaning and career development:</u>
            My strengths lie in my support. I have a good supportive partner who will be helping me through this process, financially, technically and emotionally. I also possess the recent experience of learning something completely new in my most recent job. So I know that I can learn new things out of my comfort zone. The combination of these things will help me succeed in my learning and career development.
        </p>


            <p>My limitations include, my self belief (and maintaining that), and keeping up with my own self care. It might be hard for me to juggle everything I need to during this time. So I need to manage my stress levels during this process. Limitation is also my memory. I have the type of brain that literally pushes information it considers unused outside into the forgotten lands. To manage this I will need to make time to revisit things I have learned.</p>
            
            <p><u>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</u>
            Now, I really believe from my experience in the workforce that there are some people, who no matter what you do, will always try to oppose. For every group activity or time I have to collaborate with someone, I always make sure to treat that person with kindness and respect. Listen to their ideas, and their point of view. I don’t think there are any special techniques or strategies above treating someone like you would want them to treat you. Listen to someone, ask them about their idea, try and build upon their ideas, help them develop their ideas. However not everyone will be willing to do the same, and there is not much you can do with an uncooperative team member. If taking to someone and expressing themselves does not change their bad behaviour, little else can be done, and it is up to you to continue to do your best in the situation. I have before had to work with someone, who had had previously bad experiences working with people. We were meant to be collaborating on a template for something, but as he had previously worked with people in the team who did not value his opinion, he was not interested in collaborating, and only wanted to do things in his way. To the point, where he actually procduced a document without even running it past me first. This particular scenario did not go to plan, however after this experience I tried to work out what made him act that way. It was then I discovered about his past group experience, and tried to mitigate future problems with him by opening up a dialogue. We became friends, and working with him the next time was productive and collaborative.
