      <h3> Blog 1 - Margins, Borders and Padding</h3>
      
      <p> Welcome to the first Blog on "Karmel and the Blog". We are diving into Margins, Borders and Padding, and their relationship with the content.</p>

      <p>Spend some time looking at the image inserted on the left, which shows how each component relates to one another. Margins, Borders and Padding are all a similar concept dealing with the space surrounding content. However there are some differences, and the way we use them can create interesting design concepts. Let's look at each item individually:</p>

<p>Lets start with the following image. This image of a tree will be our 'content' for this demonstration:</p>

<img id="penelotree" src="/Users/karmellithgow/Documents/My_Projects/Dev-Academy/karmel-lithgow.github.io/Images/Penetotree.jpg" alt="Hand-drawn picture of a tree">

      <p> <u>Padding</u> - The space immediatly surrounding your content is known as padding. This is the barrier between anything else on the page, and your content. We can control this using a CSS command 'padding:' followed by the amount and units you want the padding to be. By default padding is white, but in this example I am making it blue for visualisation purposes. Here is padding of 2% using CSS code <em>padding: 2%;</em>   </p>   
      <img id="penelotree-w-padding" src="/Users/karmellithgow/Documents/My_Projects/Dev-Academy/karmel-lithgow.github.io/Images/Penetotree.jpg" alt="Hand-drawn picture of a tree with padding">

      <p><u>Border</u> - You can think of a Border as a picture frame which will surround your content. It sits on the outside of the padding. In this example the border will be black. You can create a border you will need to use different properties to determine your borders colour, size and solidity. Our example uses the following: <em>border-style:solid;</em>, <em>border-color:black;</em>, <em>border-width:2%;</em></p> 
      <img id="penelotree-w-padding-border" src="/Users/karmellithgow/Documents/My_Projects/Dev-Academy/karmel-lithgow.github.io/Images/Penetotree.jpg" alt="Hand-drawn picture of a tree with padding and border">


      
      <p><u>Margin</u> - Finally today, we talk about Margins. This is the last white space which represents the space between the border and the perimiter. You cannot change colour of this, so for todays example it is the white space between the two black lines. Note, the black line on the outside would be the end of your screen. </p>
      <img id="penelotree-w-padding-border-margin" src="/Users/karmellithgow/Documents/My_Projects/Dev-Academy/karmel-lithgow.github.io/Images/Penelotree.jpg" alt="Hand-drawn picture of a tree with padding, border and margin">


<p>This was just a very shallow dive into the world of Margins, Borders and Padding. There are so many ways you can use these to create an interesting looking website. Just remember to utilise these all to make the best use of the white space.</p>
