      <h3> Blog 4 - Neuroplasticity</h3>
      
      <p><u>Neuroplasticity:</u></p>

      <p> <u>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people? </u> </p>
      <p>
        This theory puts learning in the hands of everyone and takes away an idea that you must be ‘smart’ or ‘naturally gifted’ in order to learn. It means that anyone is capable of learning new information providing you are willing to put effort in to repetition and the learning process. </p>

        <p><u> How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</u></p>
        <p>Unknowingly this is already a big part of the way I like to learn. Personally I do not have a good recall of newly learned information, so I will often write notes which I then refer to over and over again. I love the confidence aspect  that neurpolosticity offers however. The idea that if I fire these neurons enough I can learn anything does really inspire me.</p>
        <p><u>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</u></p>
        <p>Writing journals (or blog posts such as this), creating other notes pages, explaining the new concepts to people (or the cat), going over what I have learned in the day in my head before falling asleep that night. </p>
        
        <p>Here is a little video you can watch for more info: </p>

        <p>Growth Mindset</p>
        <p><u>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</u></p>

        <p>The growth mindset encourages anyone to first believe that they are capable of learning new things via the ‘not yet’ thought process, and avoiding a ‘failure’ mindset. This is such a critical thought process to have, as the moment you doubt yourself, is the moment that the learning process gets 100% harder. All the new things I am learning and still to learn will be difficult, hence the importance of focusing on a good mindset, which emphasises the importance of self belief and effort.</p>

        <p><u>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</u></p>

<p>        Yes and No. While it is intriguing that when applying these techniques that students were able to be more        successful, it also does make complete sense. I have known about the profound effect mindset can have on health and wellbeing, and general attitude towards life, it is still astounding how much we can do when in the right headspace. </p>
    
        <p><u>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey? </u></p>
        <p>Good question. This is something more I need to consider. I think for me I need to develop a morning routine which allows just a few minutes to reflect on my journey so far, with challenges and things I have overcome in mind. I may do this on my morning walk, or while on the bus. This will allow me to begin each day with a fresh encouraged approach.</p>
        
        <p><u>Blend with your learning plan and strategies:</u></p>
       <p> These concepts were already at the back of my mind while I was developing my learning plan, but I think I need to actually recall these thought more often. </p>
