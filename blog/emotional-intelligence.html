        <h3> Blog 2 - Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      
          <p> Well hello again! Welcome along to blog 2 - a little investigation into Emotional Intelligence.</p>

          <p> I have never considered myself an intellectual. I never did too well in math, am not the best at writing or science, but I have always been good at reading people. Intellectual Intelligence is the ability to read and intereperate the emotions of yourself and others. While this is not something taught in the classroom, it is a skill just as vital to your success as math and english. Having a good grip on emotional intelligence will help you diffuse, or even prevent conflicts, assist in stressful situations, and even help create and maintain good relationships. People who posess emotional intelligence have empathy, the awesome 'mind reading technique' you get by reading people's verbal and non verbal cues. If you are able to 'put yourself into someone else's shoes' it then becomes a lot easier to understand someone else and their perspective, making communication easier. </p>

          <p>  The benefits of understanding other peoples feelings are quite obvious. But emotional intelligence is more than that. We need to understand our own thoughts, feelings and motivations too. If you can understand why you are bursting with anger, it gives you the chance correct those underlying issues, so you are no longer angry, depressed, exhausted or confused. If you can identify your emotions, and then articulate that to other people, it will create an awesome space to develop good working and personal relationships. </p>
              
          <p>   Emotional intelligence is taught from an early age. If you have caregivers in your life who foster a sense of emotional wellbeing you can grow up an expert in this skill. Before doing my research on this topic, I didn't realise that it was possible to be taught emotional intelligence in a later stage in life. It is intersting to discover that this can be taught as an adult. </p>

          <p> But what if you have a high IQ? Surely that is all you need to succeed? Well, no... not quite. While a high IQ demonstrates that you are very capable of solving problems relating to reasoning eg math, it does not factor in the human element. You may achieve the best test scores which give you an awesome job... however the quality of your work may not be ideal if you are unable to work with the people around you successfully.</p>

          <p>Why is it so important though? I think a better question might be “how is this not important”? Imagine a world where no-one had the ability to understand their own, or others emotions. Where everyone would be wildly reacting to things because they couldn’t control their feelings of anger or sadness, and therefore were not able to rationalise this and alter their behaviour. Emotional intelligence is critical in human survival. Having emotional intelligence can drastically reduce conflict in most situations. Take for example a young person who has just started at your job - it is their first job and they are very nervous. As a result of their nervousness they make a very basic mistake which causes some issues for the company. You can either yell at this person for making a silly mistake which would just worsen this persons anxiety and cause more potential issues. Or, if you were able to sense this persons nervousness from the start, and take steps to reduce their nerves, the mistake might not have even occurred in the first place.</p>
