      <h3> Blog 5 - How to work out coding problems</h3>
      
         <p><u>Getting blocked on a simple problem #1</u></p>

        <p>
            I have to admit, one of the worst issues I encounter comes down to spelling errors. I can't even count the times that I have spent hours trying to work something out only to find that I have transposed two letters. Take this blog post for example. I couldn't link this page to my index.html, and I couldn't understand why. If only I spent a longer time looking at my code... I could have seen that I linked to < a href="blog/problem-so<u>vl</u>ing.html"> rather than < a href="blog/problem-solving.html">. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Another time I encountered a problem was with some CSS Styling. Throughout my blog I have been consistent with font and sizing throughout paragrahs and lists. When programming my "Javascript and the Dom" blog post, I decided to add an ordered list. I added the < ol > < /ol > tags to my index.css page and refreshed my page - I was shocked however to see that the font styling was wrong. I went back into my code, checked that I had used the correct tags, that the surrounding < p > < /p > tags were also styled correctly, and even checked the index.css again. Everything was as it should be. I played around for a good hour, wondering if I had incorrect spacing, or typed something weird. I just couldn't work it out. The rest of the page looked great... so something was really wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
            I thought back to some previous exercises I had done. Where you could inspect the page and open the console to check elements. So I gave this a go. When I clicked on my list I saw that instead of the styling being linked to index.css as expected, it was showing as linked to 'user agent stylesheet'. What on earth is that you ask? I had no idea - But it gave me something to investigate, and I took my questions straight to google. The google results told me that this was a default stylesheet which was applied when no CSS had been applied by the developer. This confused me more, as I knew for a fact this was on my stylesheet. I checked again just to be sure.  
        </p>

        <p>
            By this point I was feeling frazzled, so went to one of the Dev Academy Facilitators, who asked me "do you have two CSS stylesheets by any chance". Turns out, I had somehow made a second stylesheet, and had linked to the wrong one. All the code was right... I had just linked to the wrong one. Needless to say I was not impressed with the previous hours spent on something that should have been so easy to fix. But its a great experience which had me using a few techniques to investigate.

          Every programmer will tell you to prepare for a life full of problem solving. Expect that you will spend hours trying to fix a problem, which ends up being a simple syntax issue. That being said, there are steps you can take to speed up the process. Think about the following:

          <ul>
              <li> CHECK your work! - don't rush this. Take the time to check commas, brackets, spacing and spelling is correct.</li>
              <li> The rubber ducky method. Talk the issues through with a rubber duck, a pet, or anyone at home who is willing to listen. Just talking the problem through can often get the brain working, making it easier to solve.</li>
              <li> Try psedocode! You might be able to find what the code is lacking when working the process through 'on paper'</li>
              <li> Check the error messages. They can be helpful especially to identify syntax issues</li>
              <li> Try Console.log. This can help to understand what is happening behind the scenes.</li>
              <li> Run tests. As with pseudocode, breaking it down into small parts can help identify where the problem is coming from</li>
              <li> Ask uncle Google. If your current code solution isn't working, try something different. </li>
              <li> Reach out to facilitators, or people you know in the industry.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
