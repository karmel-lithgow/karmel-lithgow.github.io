      <h3> Reflection...</h3>
      
         <p><u>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of core learning?</u></p>

        <p>
            First thing I have learnt about myself is that I can do it. This five weeks has been full of ups and downs. There were some exercises that boosted my ego, others that I felt 'almost' broke it. and while sometimes it feels like I have learnt nothing at all, I know that I have. That's neuroplasticity at work.


            Second thing I noticed about myself is that I think quite differently than a lot of others. I can see that my approach to problem solving is very different than a lot of the other peoples approaches to things. And while it might seem that my ego could be negatively affected by this fact, it is more than ok. While at this stage I am wanting to produce the best, most consice code possible, I understand that I am learning, and I have to approach each problem in the way that makes sense to my skill set now. This will continue to improve as I learn and understand more.

            Thirdly, I have learnt that I need to be willing to ask for help from my peers. I have been somewhat afraid to ask for help on the slack channel. Mainly for fear of holding people up or feeling embarassed about not knowing the answer to a potentially 'easy' question.
        </p>

        <p> <u> What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming</u></p>

        <p>
            To give ourselves the best chance of learning, we need to provide the best possible environment. This starts with the way we view and treat ourselves. If we treat ourselves and our learning journey with kindness, understanding and empathy, we can encourage our successes and be understanding of our failures. This translates over to our cohort, workmates, and future clients. These are core stills required for success across the board. Self awareness plays into this too. If we are unaware of our own skills, intentions, strengths and weaknesses, it is going to be hard to communicate and reach our goals. Programming is not a solo profession. We will be working with other people and need these skills to ensure we end up with the best possible product.


            <p><u>What has suprised you most about the core learning?</u></p>

            <p> That would have to be the ideas around the Growth Mindset. I have to say this has been so encouraging for me over the most stressful parts of the five weeks so far.</p>

            <p><u>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</u></p>

   <p>
       The most challenging part was how hard I found it to communicate my thoughts. I was always under the impression this was something I was quite good at... until it came time to write my thoughts in a coherant way, which would be displayed for all to see. Yes, Blog posts were the hardest part.

   </p>


<p><u>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</u></p>

<p>
    Employers are not looking for people with 100% skillset, but can't operate in a team environment. While tech skills are of course important, it needs to be backed up with the ability to communicate with people (whether that is team members or managers, or even clients). By teaching us students both tech and core, we are being put into a great position where we are more marketable and have a higher chance of getting hired. 
</p>

<p><u>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead?</u></p>

<p>
    I am in two minds here. My immediate thought was "I need to be doing more...MORE programming". I think this is what most people came into the course to do, and I for one know I need to have more exposure to the tech side of things. However, the tech is intense for first time learners, and the core provides your brain a little break from the intense thinking, and shifts it over to a more holistic thought process. So I did find that aspect nice. There is also a huge need for this for people with no exposure to this other side of programming. Ultimately, I would say the core is an important aspect to the course.
